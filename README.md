  <h2>The Lyrics of FIX YOU</h2>
  <p class="title">5 September 2005</p>
  <p id="song">When you try your best but you don't succeed<br> 
When you get what you want but not what you need<br> 
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep<br> 
Stuck in reverse<br>
When the tears come streaming down your face<br> 
'Cause you lose something you can't replace<br> 
When you love someone but it goes to waste<br> 
What could it be worse?<br>
Lights will guide you home<br> 
And ignite your bones<br> 
And I will try to fix you<br>
But high up above or down below<br> 
When you are too in love to let it show<br> 
Oh but if you never try you'll never know<br> 
Just what you're worth<br>
Lights will guide you home<br> 
And ignite your bones<br> 
And I will try to fix you<br>
Tears come streaming down your face<br>
When you lose something you cannot replace<br>
oh and tears come streaming down your face<br>
And I
Tears streaming down your face<br>
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes<br>
oh and the tears streaming down your face<br>
And I<br>
Lights will guide you home<br> 
And ignite your bones<br> 
And I will try to fix you<br></p>
